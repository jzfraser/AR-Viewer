### This project is for CS 464 at Colorado State University.

This site loads AR.js and is set up to handle several different markers. The media displayed on the markers show and describe the merge sort algorithm.
The markers are all stored in the Markers directory and the media in the Media directory.

### Loading the site

Go to jzfraser.github.io to pull up this website as hosted by GitHub.

### Known issues
* The video files will not load and play on Google Chrome. This is due to autoplay being blocked by default. Firefox is the best browser to load this site on.
* Some mobile OS's and browsers also will not load/play the videos. Google Chrome and Firefox should both work with the site on mobile devices.
